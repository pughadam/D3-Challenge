          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>For this analysis I decided to look at Poverty Percentage and Income correlate to the Percent of People without 
            Healthcare.  I was able to put Percent without Healthcare on the Y Axis and have Poverty Percentage & Income (able 
            to toggle between both on the X Axis.  Below is what I can gather from the visual.)
          </p>

          <p>When looking at Poverty Percentage vs Percent without Healthcare, it is easy to see states separate on the visual.
            Right off the bat, we see the upper right hand of the graph which is both High Poverty and High Percent without 
            Healthcare.  Upon further investigation, many southern states tend to be in this bucket (MS, LA, GA, SC, AR, TX, AL,
            FL and NC).  When looking at the bottom left of the visual, this represents states with low Poverty and a lower Percentage 
            of people without Healthcare.  Many of those states tend to be in the New England/Mid Atlantic/West states (NH, MD, CT,
            NJ, HI, ND, HI, etc.). </p>

          <p>If the visual is switched from Poverty Percentage to Income in dollars, we get an additional data point that helps to
            correlate the Poverty Percentage.  On this visual, the far right represents a higher income compared with the Percent
            without Healthcare.  On this, we see a lot of the same New England/Mid Atlantic/West states also showing up with a 
            higher Income in Dollars (MA, HI, CT, DC, MD, NJ, etc.).  A similar correlation with the South states being on the upper
            left of this which represents low Income in Dollars and high Percent without Healthcare.  These states include MS, AR, AL,
            TN, LA, SC, along with others.
